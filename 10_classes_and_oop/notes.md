# JavaScript and Classes

```javascript

Yes, js does have classes . This features was introducesd with ECMAScript 2015 specification ( often referred to as ES6) . However, it's important to note that js is primarily a prototype-based language,and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanism. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++ , but under the hood, it work somewhat differently.
